==============

A Liquid syntax template engine.

__Notes__: The new version 0.2 is almost a full rewrite. Version 0.1 will continue to be maintained for fixing show-stopper bugs, but no new features should be expected.
**The new version is not compatible with the old version**. The version 0.1 documents: https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/blob/v0.1/README_en.md

Quick Start
===========
